When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It allows for you to share with others and to have a remote back up in case your hard drive fails.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be in the middle of working on something that you don't want disturbed.





Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a parallel path of development in the same repo, a fork copies a repo and a clone copies a repo to your hard drive.
