What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory, which allows git to interact with it.






How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains all files in the directory on your hard drive.  The staging area only contains the files that you will add to the git repository.






How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can do a git diff --staged to see what files are in the Staging Area with changes so that you know what will be committed to the repo.








What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you need two parallel versions of the code that are treated separately.





How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see where commits happened to each branch in relationship to each other
