What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory, which allows git to interact with it.






How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains all files in the directory on your hard drive.  The staging area only contains the files that you will add to the git repository.
